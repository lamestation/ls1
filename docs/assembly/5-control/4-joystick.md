# Step 4: Joystick

Now it's time to install the joystick, this beautiful thing,
toÂ **JOY1**.

The joystick comes with a "thumbstick cap", which is big and annoying
during assembly, so we will only attach it when it is needed.

3.  Tape the joystick into place. It will require two pieces of tape to

4.  Solder the joystick into place. The four corner pins are connected
    to ground, in a very empty area of the board. This makes them
    unusually difficult to solder, but you can do it. Just be patient
    and let the joint heat up.

5.  Finish the installation of the joystick by soldering the remaining
    pins.
