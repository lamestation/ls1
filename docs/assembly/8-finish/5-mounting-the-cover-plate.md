# Step 5: Mounting The Cover Plate

Now that everything is all good and assembled, let's put on the cover
plate so that no dirty fingers will be touching your LameStation. The
cover plate is the big plastic hunk that came in your kit.

## Tools Needed

- 1 x Cover plate
- 4 x Hex standoffs
- 8 x Screws
- 4 x AAA batteries (not included with kit)
- 1 x Thumbstick cap

## Instructions

1.  Peel the plastic off of the cover plate. Be careful not to put your
    grimy fingers on the inside of the glass, because it will stay there
    forever! Make sure you mount it cleanly and carefully.

2.  Screw on the standoffs on like with the LCD, but this time, on the
    back side.

3.  Place the cover plate down, being careful to orient it so that the
    logo is upright and the batteries are accessible.

4.  Screw the back piece onto the standoffs, starting with opposite
    corners so that it's easier to position correctly.

5.  Now is a good time to add the thumbstick cap onto the joystick,
    making sure to line up the hole with the post.
