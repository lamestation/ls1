This is the final frontier. Now you get to load your first game onto the
LameStation!

## Instructions

Pick one from the LameStation SDK's `games/` directory. I'm sure you'll
find something good; any one will do. I chose piXel, an exciting action
side-scroller, for my first game.

you get to write your own games for the LameStation\!
