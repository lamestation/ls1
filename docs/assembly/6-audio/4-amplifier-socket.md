# Step 4: Amplifier Socket

It's nice that we have this fancy, filtered signal now, but that's not
going to do us a whole lot of good *if we can't hear it*. The signal we
have is weak!

The LM386 is a nice, simple amplifier that will not only make your
signal bigger, but also give it more **POWER**, so that by the time the
signal makes it to the speaker or the headphones, you can actually hear
it!
