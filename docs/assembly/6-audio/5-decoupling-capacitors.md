# Step 5: Decoupling Capacitors

**C10** is a decoupling capacitor, but why so big? The amplifier draws a
lot of power suddenly, and if the power supply can't keep up with the
sudden demand in spike, there will be audible distortion. By adding a
very large capacitor, the amplifier is free to draw as much power as it
needs to handle it, resulting in a smoother listening experience.

**C12** is there to remove the DC component from the audio signal. This
ensure that the speaker can make the most of its dynamic range.

- 2 x 100μF capacitors

## Instructions

1.  Install the 100μF capacitors onto the board and solder them into
    place.

2.  Remember to check the polarity of the capacitors as you insert them
    into place (+ and - signs).
