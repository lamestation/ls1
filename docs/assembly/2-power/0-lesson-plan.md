# Section 2 Lesson Plan

- How does it work? What is the first thing you did to make the
  LameStation work?
- Group discussion, answer as a whole class. Turning on the power
  switch\!
- Teacher should be asking "What did you do by turning on the power
  switch?"
- Expected response: Oh, yeah, we gave it power\!@\!\!

# Resistors

## Activity

- Have the kids go from one side of the room to the other, with
  nothing in the way. That's a wire.
- Put a bunch of desks in the way, then ask them to try it again.
  You're only allowed to walk.
  - First time: nothing in the way wire
  - Second time: one or two desks in the way
  - Third time: almost completely blocked by desks.
- What if the electrons had desks in front of them? It'd be harder to
  get across\!
- Kids can't run\!

# Capacitors

- It's like a ferry. The ferry captain won't go across until there's
  enough people to get on
- Any activity that requires them to wait until something is full

## Activity:

- Kids line up outside
- Have you ever seen when 20 kids take the bus? Have you ever seen
  when only 5 kids take the bus?
- The city provides the water.
- So that only so much water goes into the tank, and it's only so hot,
  it has to be regulated.
- A power adapter is like a pipe that comes from the city. A battery
  is like a storage tank in your backyard.
- Whose ever taken a shower, and after awhile, it's gotten cold? Why
  do you think that happened?
  - We ran out of hot water\!
- Why do you think you only have a certain amount of water? In every
  one of our houses, we have this water heater that can only heat so
  much.
- As long as you only use water at a certain rate, you'll always be
  able to take a hot shower. But if you use it too fast, it'll get
  cold.
- How many of you have taken a cold shower?
- How do you make it warm? We have to heat it up\!
  - So we have this thing called a water heater. You heat it up\!

## Assessment

- Try to draw a capacitor water tower
