# Section 2: Power

![](images/prog_power.png)

The last section that you did was the first step: adding the DC power
jack. Now that you've gotten a little more familiar with soldering, we
can finish it.

## Overview

The LameStation is powered in one of two ways; using the on-board 4AAA
battery pack or an external DC power supply. You do not need to worry
about conflicts between the two. The LS automatically switches between
the two sources using a shunt switch in the power jack.

The battery pack is a large, plastic obstruction to everything else you
need to assemble, so this is one of the last items to go on the board,
much later.

You will be introduced to a few things here: resistors, capacitors, and
diodes.
