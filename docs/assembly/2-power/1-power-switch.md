# Step 1: Power Switch

You will be installing the power switch. This switch opens and closes
the LameStation circuit.

When the circuit is **closed**, electrical current can flow, so the
power is turned on.

When the circuit is **open**, no electrical current can get through, so
power is not consumed, and the device is off.

        Some components, like this one, won't be flush with the edge of the
        board; _that's okay_\! If it fits in the footprint, and it's on the
        correct side of the board, you're good to go.
