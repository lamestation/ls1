# Hardware Bug Fix (P5 Only)

This step is only necessary for P5 prototype boards.

Due to a long, convoluted story involving auto-routing, ground fill, and
KiCad DRC and rat's nest functionality, one of the traces is missing.
This will stop the board from turning on.

## Tools Needed

- Soldering iron
- Tweezers

## Parts Needed

- 1 x jumper wire

## Instructions

1.  Get a short piece of wire trimming left over from a previous wire
    cut, and align it between the two highlighted points on the front of
    the board.

2.  Hold the wire in place with tweezers, then reheat the solder from
    the existing connection until the wire attaches.

3.  Once held in place, add more solder to get a stronger connection.

Your board should now be able to power on\!
