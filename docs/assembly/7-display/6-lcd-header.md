## Instructions

1.  Line up the headers with the pins on the LCD. Remember, the short

    meet the socket.

2.  Gently tape the header in place so that it stays upright and secure

4.  This process may melt the place on the header a small amount. If
    that happens, you can use pliers to correct any pins that might have
    become misaligned.
