# Step 3: Decoupling Capacitors

You will now be installing tiny 0.1μF ceramic capacitors
into **C6** and **C7**. These are simple decoupling capacitors that
filter noise on the microcontroller's power lines.

## Tools Needed

- Soldering iron
- Cutter

## Parts Needed

- 2 x 0.1μF ceramic capacitor

## Instructions

1.  Seat the capacitors into the board at C6 and C7. Ceramic capacitors
    are not polarized, so it does not matter which way you insert them
    as long as they are on the correct side of the board.

2.  Solder into place.

3.  Trim the lead wires.
