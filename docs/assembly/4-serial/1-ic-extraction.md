# Step 1: IC Extraction

In the last section, you installed
the 40-pin Propeller chip and the 8-pin EEPROM into their sockets to
test the board. Before we can continue, we need to remove the chips so
that we don't overheat them or damage them when we continue
soldering.

## Tools Needed

- Small flat-head screwdriver

## Instructions

This section needs more photos\!

1.  Starting at either end of the chip, insert the screw driver between
    the chip and the socket along the edge. Gently twist the screwdriver
    while gradually wedging it in between the chip and the socket.

2.  Once the chip comes a little loose, remove the screw driver and
    start the same process on the other end of the chip, gradually
    forcing more space in between them until the chip gently lifts
    free.

It can be a little tricky, so be patient, and make sure you do not bend
the pins. No matter what you do, do not bend pins\! Once they snap,
that's it.

!!! warning "Do not bend the pins!"

    I can't emphasize this enough. While you need to bend it very slightly
    to fit it into the socket, bend an IC pin too far, and it will snap
    right off. Then it's game over for you until you replace the chip.
    Patience is a virtue; be VERY careful\!

- NEED SECTION ON EEPROM REMOVAL

!!! warning "Protect you ICs!"

    Remember to place the ICs back on the special black foam they came
    on.

    This foam protects the chip from ESD (electro-static-discharge).
    Â Electrostatic discharge are those tiny shocks you feel when you get
    close to a metallic door knob, or the same energy that makes your hair
    stand up when you rub your feet against the carpet at home. While it may
    seem harmless to people, it can be very bad news for our chip - so keep
    it safe\!
