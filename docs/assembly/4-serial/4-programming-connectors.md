2.  Find the J3 socket on the back of the board and install the
    connector. Make sure you place it on the correct side of the
    board.

    It will snap into place.

4.  The snapping connectors do not *need* to be soldered, but it helps
    make the connector more sturdy and resistant to damage in case, say,
    you drop your LameStation on the floor while still connected to your
    desktop (true story\!). So go ahead and solder them too.

5.  Solder the 4-pin socket to **P3**.

    With this connector installed, you can use the [Prop
    Plug](http://www.parallax.com/product/32201) to program the
    LameStation instead of the serial port.
