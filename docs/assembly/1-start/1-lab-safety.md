# Step 1: Lab Safety

!!! danger "ALCOHOL CAN CATCH FIRE!"

    Keep it away from sources of heat, including the solder iron. Failure to
    do so may result in fire, or worse!

    - After cleaning, make sure to remove all alcohol from the board
      before continuing to solder.

!!! danger "MOLTEN SOLDER CAN SPLASH IN YOUR FACE!"

    - Wear safety goggles while working to make sure nothing gets in your
      eyes.

    - Don't put your head too close to the board while soldering to
      avoid solder splash getting in your face.

!!! danger "SOLDERING IRONS ARE HOT!"

    Soldering irons operate at CRAZY temperatures\! The handle on the iron
    can get hot. That's okay, but **DO NOT EVER TOUCH** the rest of it. It
    is **extremely hot** and will burn a lot\!

    - Don't touch the hot part, **YOU WILL GET BURNED**.
