# Step 4: Cleaning The Board

After every section, you shouldÂ *clean the board*. Usually factories
will bathe the entire board in a cleaning solution, but that is
problematic to do in a classroom because it creates a lot of fumes, or
gases that are harmful to breathe. So we will use a paper towel instead.

It will get more difficult to remove the crud the longer you wait to do
it, so do it as quick as you can.

        Keep the alcohol away from the iron at all times.

2.  Gently dab, don't rub, on the surface, so that lots of alcohol flows
    onto the surface.

3.  Now scrub the surface with a toothbrush, making sure to get off the
    debris of where you applied the alcohol. Do make sure to scrub until
    the surface is no longer wet from the alcohol and is clean from
    debris.

    !!! tip "Keep scrubbing!"

        Don't be shy! Keep scrubbing until you are satisfied. It won't be
        perfect, and it doesn't have to be. A clean board will look better
        and last longer.
