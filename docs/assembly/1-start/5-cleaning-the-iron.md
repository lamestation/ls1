# Step 5: Cleaning The Iron

You're going to notice pretty quickly that black crud starts forming on
the tip of your soldering iron. Not only is this nasty looking, but it
also terribly impedes the heat transfer from your iron to the component,
making soldering much more difficult.

Then have at it\!

## Instructions

### Method 1: Tinning With Solder

This is your first line of defense against oxidation.Â Usually just
adding some solder to the tip then wiping the iron across the sponge
does the trick.

### Method 2: Tinning With Tip Tinner / Cleaner

When tinning with solder doesn't seem to be working, now you need to
take out the bigger guns. While it's essentially the same process at
work as with Method 1, it uses much stronger stuff, so it does a better
job.

### Method 3: Sand Paper

This method is a **last resort**. Use sparingly as it will wear away the
tip of your iron pretty fast if you're not careful.

Most of the time Methods 1 and 2 are enough, but sometimes the crud can
get baked on there so thick that the only way to get it off is with
sandpaper.

You want a very fine grit, like 300 or higher. A sanding sponge is even
easier to use because it the tip of the iron is so small.

Gently rub around all sides of the tip until you start seeing the gunk
coming off. Once it's clean, don't sand it anymore, because then you're
wearing down the iron itself.
